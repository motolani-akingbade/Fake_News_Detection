# ðŸ“° AI-Powered Fake News & Misinformation Detection System

This project focuses on detecting fake news and AI-generated content using machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) techniques. It integrates TF-IDF, Logistic Regression, and GPT-2 generated headlines to build a robust misinformation detection pipeline. Real-world testing, root cause analysis, and ethical considerations are incorporated using the Toyota Business Practice.
